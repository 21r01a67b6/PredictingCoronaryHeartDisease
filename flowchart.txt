9. Training and Building the model
Flask Framework
----------------
 
10. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
11. Importing the packages
12. User gives input as Feature Values 
13. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
14. Trained model is used for prediction
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend
Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentioned to use heart disease Dataset with Machine learning models like AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Bagging, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM with Focal Loss, LightGBM w/o Focal Loss which got  93.3 %  of test accuracy as per author, 
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier which got 99% accuracy,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
